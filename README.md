# HomeScope
Homemade Raspi-Cam based digital microscope system capable of recording video and/or image capture (time-lapse microscopy) while robotically scanning an area of 70 x 70 mm squared.

We thinker with Cambridge’s OpenLabTools ‘s microscope  and the open source drawing CNC micro-robot PlotterBot and came up with the HomeScope; a DIY biologist solution for developing robotic spatial-scanning capabilities for the home laboratory.
