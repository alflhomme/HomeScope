# HomeScope
Homemade RaspiCam/Arduino-based digital microscope system capable of recording video and image capture (time-lapse microscopy) while robotically scanning a sample.

We thinker with Cambridge’s OpenLabTools‘s microscope and the open-source drawing CNC micro-robot PlotterBot, and came up with the HomeScope; a DIY biologist solution for developing robotic microscopy capabilities for the home laboratory.
